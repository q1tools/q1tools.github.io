Summary of the level
====================

This map was started at the same time as the rest of the UKPAK maps,
and was finished *way* after the rest. The map began life from within
Qoole 2.50 and was later transferred to Qoole '99. For what its worth,
I wouldn't advise anyone else to try doing that.

There are a couple of interesting features. Firstly, there are a couple
ladders. To move up them, just walk into them (don't press or hold jump).
Secondly, you might notice that nearly all stairs are actually ramps. Do
"r_drawentities 0" and you'll see that the steps are for decoration.

Thanks to rest of the UKPAK team for support like encouragement,
testing, comments, textures, and of course having faith that I'd
eventually finish it :) Cheers guys.
