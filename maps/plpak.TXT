::PLPAK

PLPAK offers you 9 new deathmatch maps designed for 2v2 player games.
All are designed and made by Polish mappers.

You should know what BSP files are for... :P so I'll remind only, that LOC files are used by proxy (mQWCL or Qizmo)
for navigating and locating yourself in a level.

I'd like to thank everybody who helped me with PLPAK.
I hope you'll enjoy and comment on our work.
